# Matlab Quadcopter Simulation

This repository contains an already set-up Matlab simulation of the Quadcopter dynamics.
In order to let the simulation correctly work, I suggest you to work with the following files:
* runsim.m (this is the script that you should run)
* controller.m (here you can implement your own quadcopter regulator)
* crazyflie.m (here you can change the simulation parameters)

Moreover, I suggest you to have a look at the "trajectories" folder, where you can implement new trajectories and allow the uav to follow whatever motion.
